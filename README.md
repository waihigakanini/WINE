# Clustering Analysis with Python: Project
Champagne Company is a leading wine company that specialises in the importation and distribution of
premium and super-premium wines, champagnes and spirits within the East African region. The main goal
of the company is to make the most exclusive brands of wine more accessible at an affordable price. The
company wants to satisfy the growing local demand for specialised products and the ever-increasing
tourism industry where guests donÂ´t want to settle for less. Your task as a Data Scientist working for this
company is to perform wine segmentation given the following dataset. The dataset is the results of a
chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Kenya but derived from three different cultivars.
Upon modeling, you will be required to perform statistical analysis on the clusters highlighting key findings
and making recommendations on business decisions based on your findings.
You will be required to go through the following stages: - Define the Research Question - Data Importaion
- Data Exploration - Data Cleaning - Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) - Data Preparation - Data
Modeling - Model Evaluation - Challenging your Solution - Challenging your Solution - Recommendations /
Conclusion Use the following template as a guide to go through the above steps:
